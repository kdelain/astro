### Astronomy Labs
Note: Most labs have a Packet (with instructions) and Questions (for students to hand in). 

* Solar Heating: Discover the three main observational causes of the seasons, and link to the physical cause of Earth's tilt + revolution around the sun. Uses free planetarium software *Stellarium*. (Packet Only; questions inside packet)
* X-ray SNe: Investigate the measurements and methods for figuring out chemical composition of stars, then discuss the stellar gas cycle as pertains to star formation. Adapted from the CLEA lab, uses their software *XMMLab*.
* Exobiology: Webquest-style lab investigating the origins of life. Then use *Kepler* data to discover exoplanets that life could be on! [Website](http://kishar.net/teaching/astro/Exobiology/) with spreadsheet and links.
* Polar Vortex: Work through an understanding of how the jet stream varies based on difference between equatorial and polar temperatures. Challenging lab for intro astronomy; better suited to a weather class or a course with science majors.
* Galaxy Classification: Devise your own classification of galaxies based on morphology and color. Compare to Hubble's classification and discuss possible ages of galaxies. Then create your own galaxy image using free image processing software Gimp. Images compiled from University of St. Thomas' 17" telescope student observing nights.
