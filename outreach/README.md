# Aviation Activities

* Weather Fronts & Systems: adapted from a NOAA exercise, this older kid activity shows the connection between pressure, changes in pressure, and temperatures to predict the weather
* Cloud Identification: for all ages, identify clouds based on their shape and other features. Connections to expected weather as well. Based on [this NOAA poster](http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/cloud_chart)
* Airplane Stall demonstration: similar to a real stall test, demonstrates the disconnect of the streamlines over the wing. See my [Youtube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvc68zUhFJ8)
